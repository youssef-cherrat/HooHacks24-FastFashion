                    At GreenThreads, our mission is driven by a commitment to
                    sustainability and a passion for positive change in the
                    fashion industry. We recognize the significant environmental
                    impact of fast fashion, including waste and excessive
                    resource consumption. By facilitating access to second-hand
                    clothing from small, local businesses and individual
                    sellers, we aim to reduce waste, support local economies,
                    and promote a more sustainable lifestyle. Our work is rooted
                    in the belief that fashion can be both stylish and
                    sustainable, and we're dedicated to proving that every day
                    by offering environmentally friendly fashion choices that
                    make a difference for our planet.
